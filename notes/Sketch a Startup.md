# Sketch a Startup

## Start with the money

* Staffing
  * Who does what?
  * How many people do we need?
  * How much will we pay?
* Infrastructure
  * Where will the start-up be located?
  * What materials do we need?
  * How much will it cost?
* Implementation
  * How will the business run?
  * How will we get customers?
  * How will we deliver products or services? How much will we charge?

## Visual map tips

Suggested ways to visually illustrate the major elements of a start-up plan (1 of the 2)

* Flows vertically from the top of a page to the bottom to show organizational leadership
* Flows horizontally from left to right to demonstrate activity over time

Tips:

* Sketch freely and wildly for the first sketch
  * Donâ€™t restrict your thinking
  * Brainstorm with pictures, shapes, and other graphical elements
* Sketch several maps for different purposes
  * For example, one sketch for the organizational chart and another for timelines
  * Or, one sketch for an internal map and another that includes external partners
* Sketch simply
  * Complex maps overwhelm and shut down planning.
  * Keep things as simple as possible while mapping out the major sections
  * Not every detail needs to be mapped
* Sketch connections
  * Use solid lines to show established or existing leadership, management, or responsibility
  * Use dotted lines to show proposed connections or advisory oversight

## Start up or start over?

Asking hard questions reveals weaknesses in the design of the startup. e.g.:

* Insufficient funding
* Unrealistic role expectations (one position managing too many responsibilities)
* Lack of infrastructure
* Delusional thinking about recruitment, sales, or marketing

1 of the 2 things should follow the uncomfortable conversation:

* A revised sketch
* Defensive arguing
